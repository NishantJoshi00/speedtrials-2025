# Lib Directory

This directory contains shared utilities, configurations, and helper functions:

## Structure

- **utils/**: General utility functions and helpers
- **config/**: Application configuration and constants
- **validations/**: Form validation schemas and functions
- **api/**: API client functions and data fetching utilities

## Guidelines

1. Keep functions pure when possible
2. Use TypeScript for type safety
3. Include comprehensive JSDoc comments
4. Write unit tests for complex utilities
5. Export functions using named exports
6. Group related utilities in the same file

## Best Practices

- Prefer immutable operations
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
- Use descriptive function names
- Avoid side effects in utility functions
- Consider performance implications
